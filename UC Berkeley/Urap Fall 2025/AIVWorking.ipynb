    "This notebook builds and runs a full pipeline around IMF Article IV reports:\n",
    "- creates a manifest of country/year/IMF URLs,\n",
    "- downloads the corresponding Article IV PDFs,\n",
    "- extracts full-text and the \"Executive Board Assessment\" (EBA) section from PDFs,\n",
    "- scrapes the HTML \"Summary\" section from IMF country report pages,\n",
    "- tracks all statuses and paths in a single `data/manifest.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it does it\n",
    "- Uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to:\n",
    "  - find the Article IV PDF link on each IMF page,\n",
    "  - download the PDF file.\n",
    "- Uses a **manifest CSV** as the central state:\n",
    "  - one row per report,\n",
    "  - columns for ISO codes, year, URLs, status, file paths, snippets, notes.\n",
    "- Uses `pdfminer.six` to:\n",
    "  - convert PDFs to plain text,\n",
    "  - extract the \"Executive Board Assessment\" section as a separate text file.\n",
    "- Uses a second HTML scraper:\n",
    "  - fetches the IMF HTML page,\n",
    "  - extracts the on-page \"Summary\" section,\n",
    "  - saves it to text and logs a short snippet.\n",
    "- Each stage updates the manifest with a new `status` and the relevant paths."

    "## 6. Extract HTML \"Summary\" sections from IMF country report pages\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this does at a high level\n",
    "For each Article IV report in the manifest, fetches the IMF HTML page and:\n",
    "- extracts the on-page \"Summary\" section,\n",
    "- saves it to `data/text/<ISO2>/<year>_summary.txt`,\n",
    "- stores a short snippet and status flags in `data/manifest.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it does it\n",
    "- Reuses:\n",
    "  - `DATA_DIR = \"data\"`,\n",
    "  - `TEXT_DIR = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, \"text\")`,\n",
    "  - `MANIFEST_PATH = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, \"manifest.csv\")`.\n",
    "- Creates a shared `requests.Session()` with a custom `User-Agent`:\n",
    "  - `SESSION = requests.Session()`,\n",
    "  - `SESSION.headers.update({\"User-Agent\": \"urap-sovereign-debt/1.0 (summary-scraper)\"})`\n",
    "  so that requests identify your project politely.\n",
    "- `ensure_dirs()`:\n",
    "  - ensures `data/text/` exists.\n",
    "- `read_manifest()` / `write_manifest()`:\n",
    "  - same pattern as previous sections; this stage also updates the same manifest file.\n",
    "- `fetch_imf_html(url)`:\n",
    "  - uses `SESSION.get(url, timeout=30)` to download the HTML,\n",
    "  - checks for HTTP errors via `resp.raise_for_status()`,\n",
    "  - returns `resp.text`.\n",
    "- `extract_summary_from_html(html)`:\n",
    "  - parses the HTML with `BeautifulSoup(html, \"html.parser\")`,\n",
    "  - finds the \"Summary\" heading and then gathers the text in the paragraphs following it,\n",
    "  - stops when it encounters metadata headings like `\"Subject:\"`, `\"Keywords:\"`, or `\"Publication Details\"`,\n",
    "  - joins collected parts into one `summary_text` string and returns it.\n",
    "- `main()`:\n",
    "  - calls `ensure_dirs()` and `read_manifest()`,\n",
    "  - ensures these columns exist for each row:\n",
    "    - `summary_path`, `summary_snippet`, `summary_status`,\n",
    "    - `notes` (preserving any earlier notes).\n",
    "  - loops over each row with a non-empty `imf_url`:\n",
    "    1. fetches the HTML page via `fetch_imf_html(imf_url)`,\n",
    "    2. runs `extract_summary_from_html(html)`:\n",
    "       - if non-empty:\n",
    "         - saves it as `data/text/<ISO2>/<year>_summary.txt`,\n",
    "         - sets `summary_path` and `summary_status = \"summary_extracted\"`,\n",
    "         - builds a short `summary_snippet` (e.g., first ~400–500 characters, cleaned of newlines),\n",
    "       - if empty:\n",
    "         - sets `summary_status = \"summary_missing\"`,\n",
    "         - keeps `summary_path` and `summary_snippet` empty.\n",
    "    3. on success, clears `notes` or appends info as needed.\n",
    "  - on exception:\n",
    "    - prints an error message,\n",
    "    - sets:\n",
    "      - `summary_status = \"summary_error\"`,\n",
    "      - `summary_path = \"\"`, `summary_snippet = \"\"`,\n",
    "      - appends a `\"summary_error: <exception>\"` tag into `notes` without discarding existing notes.\n",
    "  - writes everything back via `write_manifest(rows, fieldnames)` and prints a confirmation.\n",
    "  - the `if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()` block allows running this summary extraction step on its own.\n"
