This paper focuses on Bangladesh’s 2023 Article IV Consultation, First Reviews under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement, Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility, and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility Arrangement, Requests for a Waiver of Nonobservance of a Performance Criterion, and Modifications of Performance Criteria. Near-term policies should continue to focus on containing inflation and rebuilding external resilience. This requires a calibrated monetary policy tightening, supported by a neutral fiscal stance, and greater exchange rate flexibility to alleviate foreign exchange pressures and rebuild buffers. Raising tax revenues and rationalizing expenditures will allow increasing social, developmental, and climate-related spending. Continued efforts to enhance public financial and investment management are needed to increase spending efficiency and mitigate fiscal risks. Building resilience to climate change and natural disasters is a priority for achieving high, inclusive, and green growth. In this context, strengthening institutions, improving climate spending efficiency, and mobilizing climate financing remain crucial.
