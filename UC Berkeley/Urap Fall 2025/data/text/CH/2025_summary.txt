Switzerland remains highly resilient, supported by strong institutions, prudent policies, and a skilled labor force. However, global uncertainty, trade fragmentation, and persistent safe-haven flows have increased economic pressures. After slowing in 2024, growth picked up in early 2025 including due to front-loaded exports, but momentum remains tepid. Inflation has fallen to near zero despite policy easing by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). U.S. tariffs to Swiss goods were raised to 39 percent (excluding, inter alia, pharmaceuticals and gold) in August 2025.
