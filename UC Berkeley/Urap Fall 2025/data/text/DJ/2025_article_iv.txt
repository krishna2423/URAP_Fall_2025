IMF Executive Board Concludes 2025 Article IV Consultation with 
Djibouti 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Washington, DC – September 11, 2025: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Djibouti and considered and endorsed the staff 
appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis. 

Djibouti’s recent and foreseeable growth remains steady with moderate inflation, supported by 
Ethiopia’s expansive market and strong transshipment amid Red Sea tensions. The fiscal and 
reserves positions improved in 2024 after a brief period of fiscal overruns. In a challenging global 
climate, the authorities’ focus on macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability, and economic 
diversification to support job creation is commendable.  

Djibouti’s priorities are to reduce debt and continue rebuilding reserves, through ongoing debt 
negotiations and prudent fiscal management. While government revenues are limited compared to 
spending needs for development and debt service, segments of the state-owned enterprises (SOE) 
exhibit robust profitability. Mobilizing their dividends for debt service and reserve accumulation, 
implementing efficiency-enhancing SOE reforms, standardizing tax regimes to broaden the tax base, 
limiting non-essential expenditures, and applying a medium-term debt strategy remain key 
priorities. 

Private sector development is key to boosting formal jobs. Enhancing investment in health and 
education to strengthen human capital, substantially narrowing tax exemptions, and implementing 
energy sector reforms, are essential elements in building a more inclusive growth model. 

1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every 
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the 
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms 
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment 

Djibouti is positioned to leverage its economic resilience to tackle fiscal and development 
challenges. Djibouti has handled recent shocks well, maintaining solid growth despite Red Sea 
tensions, with moderate inflation and rising reserves. Logistics investments over the past decade 
have boosted growth and economic transformation but increased external debt, leaving limited 
fiscal space considering development needs. In a challenging global climate, the authorities’ focus 
on macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability, and economic diversification to support job creation 
is commendable.  

Growth stays robust amid regional conflicts. Economic growth is expected to have surpassed 6½ 
percent of GDP in 2024, driven by higher transshipment activity alongside robust expansion in the 
construction, commerce, telecommunications and tourism sectors. Moderation in international food 
and energy prices has contributed to keeping inflation contained. In 2024, substantial fiscal 
consolidation was realized, which aided in rebuilding reserves and partially offset the decline seen 
since late 2023; however, reserve levels remain below the monetary base. The authorities’ plan to 
maintain strong fiscal consolidation, aiming for a government surplus this year and a balanced 
budget in the medium term, is welcome.  

The outlook is positive but faces risks amid global uncertainty. Growth is projected to remain strong 
at about 6 percent in 2025, then to stabilize near 5½ percent in the medium term, largely driven by 
Ethiopia’s strong demand for port services. Inflation is projected to remain subdued in line with 
global energy and food prices. External risks include heightened instability in the Horn of Africa with 
increased migration potentially straining social conditions amid constrained fiscal space, reduced 
development aid, new competition from nearby ports, and global policy shifts possibly weakening 
the dollar and Djibouti franc, spurring service exports but raising inflation.   

Djibouti needs to restore debt sustainability and rebuild reserves through a mix of fiscal 
consolidation, SOE reform, and debt negotiations. Clearing all arrears and finalizing debt 
negotiations is key to restore debt sustainability, alongside the containment of public and publicly 
guaranteed debt through quantified and enforced ceilings on both SOE and central government 
debt. This should be complemented by durable fiscal consolidation. To sustain progress, it is 
imperative to ensure the effective implementation of the revenue and expenditure measures 
outlined in the authorities’ 2024–27 Action Plan for fiscal reforms as well as rationalize tax 
expenditures associated with the derogatory regimes. 

3

Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to accelerate SOE governance reform. Swiftly 
implementing the Code of Good SOE Governance, including by collecting financial statements from 
all SOEs to allow performance monitoring, together with enforcing a transparent dividend policy, 

and gradually deleveraging those highly indebted, will contribute to achieving debt sustainability. In 
addition, staff encourages the authorities to review the SOE portfolio to determine whether to 
retain, restructure, or divest each entity to improve the efficiency of the sector. The authorities 
should also apply a market-based approach to financial settlement practices between SOEs and the 
state.  

Building on the recent recovery in reserves, the authorities should pursue a comprehensive strategy 
to strengthen the currency board. Alongside amending the CBD law to enhance its autonomy and 
implementing reserve requirements incrementally, the CBD should consider retaining future CBD 
profits to further bolster reserves. Furthermore, sustaining fiscal consolidation and leveraging 
dividends from profitable SOEs, including ex-SWF entities, remain essential measures to minimize 
the recurrence of overdrafts.   

Speeding up reforms to boost private investment, diversify the economy, and create jobs would 
further support the authorities’ commitment to inclusive growth. Leveling the playing field between 
companies operating under the general and special regimes, and lowering electricity costs by 
curbing government agencies' overuse and improving bill collection, will buttress Djibouti’s 
investment momentum. Enhancing SME financing and strengthening education and job training 
under the 2021–35 education master plan is essential for private sector growth and the effective 
implementation of the ‘Vision 2035’ national development strategy.  

High quality data coverage will support policy making and strengthen surveillance. The authorities 
have taken important steps to improve the dissemination and quality of macroeconomic statistics 
and are determined to further improve the coverage and consistency of national, fiscal, and external 
accounts data in line with DAA requirements. Advancements in data compilation methods and the 
timely publication of statistics will further enhance economic analysis and policy making.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2025 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION 

KEY ISSUES 
Context. Djibouti's investment-focused strategy has propelled average growth rates to about 
6 percent over the past decade, leading to a doubling of GDP per capita. However, substantial 
public investment coupled with declining revenues and rising debt service have constrained fiscal 
space and put pressure on debt sustainability. In 2024, growth remained strong at about 
6½ percent, driven by robust transshipment amid Red Sea maritime disruptions. Inflation was 
moderate, and fiscal and reserve positions improved following temporary overruns. The 
authorities are pursuing fiscal consolidation and debt negotiations to restore debt sustainability 
and strengthen reserves.  

Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to hold at about 6 percent in 2025 and stay robust over 
the medium term, fueled by rising Ethiopian demand for Djibouti's port services. Inflation is 
expected to ease as global food and energy prices moderate. Risks to the outlook include 
heightened instability in the Horn of Africa and increased migration potentially straining social 
conditions, reduced development aid, and new competition from nearby ports. On the upside, a 
potential weakening of the dollar may help boost port activity, and private sector investment 
may exceed expectations, supported by Djibouti’s stable economy, currency board, modern 
ports, and connectivity to Ethiopia's expansive market. 

Policy recommendations. Priorities include restoring debt sustainability through effective fiscal 
consolidation, State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform, and debt negotiations, as well as 
strengthening the currency board and promoting inclusive growth. Key policy recommendations: 

• Advance fiscal consolidation by broadening tax revenues, rationalizing non-priority spending,
and enforcing SOE dividend payments to the budget; set comprehensive debt ceilings that
include all public and publicly guaranteed debt. Complete debt renegotiations and arrears
clearance with creditors.

•

•

•

Further SOE reform by ensuring timely disclosure of all financial statements and
strengthening their oversight, enabling the commercial operation of SOEs through a
framework governing their financial relations with the government, and finalizing the SOE
portfolio review to determine which entities to retain, restructure, or divest to improve the
efficiency of the sector.

Continue to rebuild reserves by maintaining fiscal discipline, mobilizing SOE dividends, and
reinforcing the central bank's autonomy under the currency board.

Promote economic diversification and job growth by prioritizing investments in human
capital, standardizing taxation across different regimes while substantially narrowing tax
exemptions, and continue reforming the energy sector.

CONTEXT 
1.       Leveraging its strategic location, 
Djibouti doubled GDP per capita over the 
past decade. The country’s location on the 
Red Sea and its five foreign military bases 
have been supporting regional stability. 
Leveraging its proximity to Ethiopia’s large 
and growing market, Djibouti has made 
substantial investments and advanced the 
modernization of its economy. The 
development of new ports and high-quality 
infrastructure—including a railway and a 
water pipeline to Ethiopia—has propelled 
average growth rates to about 6 percent, 
doubling GDP per capita between 2013 and 
2023.

2.       However, growth has not generated sufficient jobs, government revenues have 
declined, and debt service has risen, constraining fiscal space. Despite high growth, fewer than 
one third of the working-age population are formally employed. Moreover, government revenues 
have fallen as a share of GDP due to widespread tax exemptions benefiting port activities, free 
economic zones, and military bases, as well as tax evasion. Grant support has also decreased amid a 
global decline in development aid. These, along with investment financing, have resulted in 
escalating external public debt from nearly 40 percent a decade ago to an unsustainable 70 percent 
of GDP currently. As of March 2025, the country remains in arrears to eleven creditors, with 
outstanding obligations totaling about 2.7 percent of GDP. A debt service moratorium with Exim 
Bank China is currently in place, effectively deferring the repayment of significant principal and 
interest payments until 2028.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
3.       Economic growth in 2024 was strong despite regional conflicts. It is estimated to have 
surpassed 6½ percent, supported by a 7.4 percent increase in overall port activity and rebounds in 
the construction, commerce, telecommunications and tourism sectors. The increase in port activity 
was dominated by a 98 percent surge in transshipments,1 as shipping operators rerouted to 
circumvent Red Sea tensions and comply with UN regulations for vessels bound for Yemen.2 In 
contrast, port traffic for Ethiopia experienced a slowdown, accompanied by a decline in both 
railway and road traffic to the neighboring country. Port activity for Djibouti registered a modest 
growth.

Inflation remained contained in 2024 and moderated throughout the year. Headline 

4.      
inflation rose to 2.1 percent, up from 1.4 percent in 2023, with core inflation accounting for 
approximately one-third of the overall acceleration, and food and energy inflation for two-thirds. 
Inflation continued its steady decline in 2025, averaging -1½ percent from January to May 2025, as 
lower global food and energy prices were passed through to domestic prices. The closer alignment of 
domestic prices with international prices has temporarily reduced fuel subsidies to about 0.25 percent 
of GDP in 2024 (in addition to revenues foregone due to tax exemptions). This is down from about 
1 percent of GDP in 2022 during peak international prices. 

5.       A significant fiscal effort was delivered in 2024. Faced with financing constraints and 
seeking to limit the Treasury’s overdraft at the Central Bank of Djibouti (CBD), the authorities 
restrained capital expenditure and effectively mobilized revenue. Revenues from the business profit 
tax and SOE dividends rose by 0.7 and almost 1 percentage points of GDP respectively, and 

1 Transshipment refers to transferring cargo from a larger vessel to a smaller one to ensure more efficient transport. 

2 Djibouti has become a pivotal hub for Asia-Europe trade as shipping companies skirt the Red Sea in favor of safer 
routes around Africa. Merchandise off-loading from large vessels in Djibouti, and re-shipping on smaller boats to 
Yemen, allows the conduct of necessary inspections to prevent illegal shipments.

successful negotiations secured a 0.13 percentage point of GDP increase in military lease revenues. 
As a result, the fiscal deficit stood at 2.6 percent of GDP, reflecting a 1 percentage point of GDP 
reduction in the primary deficit. However, fiscal vulnerabilities remained high, particularly 
considering the outstanding external arrears accumulated in earlier years, which amounted to 
2.7 percent of GDP as of March 2025.

6.       The current account surplus is estimated to have narrowed in 2024. Djibouti’s imports 
and exports have traditionally been volatile, primarily driven by transit trade with neighboring 
Ethiopia.3 In 2024, rising tensions among countries in the Horn of Africa led to a contraction in road 
and rail traffic, hindering re-exports to Ethiopia. This outweighed the decrease in imports to Djibouti, 
which resulted from the surge in freight and insurance rates during the Red Sea shipping crisis. 
Overall, the current account balance deteriorated by 4 percentage points to 14.2 percent of GDP. 
Djibouti’s external position in 2024 was substantially stronger than what is justified by fundamentals 
and desirable policies (Annex II) although the analysis of the external sector is affected by data quality 
issues, and Djibouti's debt distress, elevated foreign debt service payments, and weakened reserves 
position underscore the need to strengthen the external position to safeguard the currency board. 

7.       Gross reserves are recovering, following a decline since late 2023. Reserves fell by 
15 percent year-on-year in December 2023, followed by a further decline of 31½ percent year-on-
year in December 2024, primarily due to the increase in Treasury’s overdrafts at the CBD, which 
cumulatively amounted to about 5 percent of GDP (or 32 percent of the CBD’s total assets). These 
overdrafts were used to finance current and capital expenditures with high-import component in 
2023, and debt amortization payments in 2024. However, the 2024 fiscal consolidation allowed 
reserves to rebound by 5.2 percent in December 2024. This trend continued in Q1 2025 QoQ, driven 
by sustained fiscal consolidation, military lease payments and budget support from the French 

3 In Djibouti, re-exports involve storing goods in the free trade zone for shipment to other countries, primarily 
Ethiopia. These goods are exempt from taxes unless reintroduced into the domestic market. Re-exports represent 
over 90 percent of the total goods exports recorded in Djibouti’s Balance of Payments (BoP). Their impact on 
Djibouti’s BoP is significant, as not all imports intended for re-exports are dispatched within the same year. 
Contributing factors include stock management in the free trade zone aimed at optimizing price gains, and 
disruptions in inland trade routes resulting from political instability in the Horn of Africa.

8.       The banking sector remains resilient. The capital adequacy ratio rose from 18.7 percent in 
2023 to 23.3 percent in 2024, exceeding the 12 percent regulatory minimum, while nonperforming 
loans declined by roughly a quarter to approximately 3.1 percent in 2024. These developments 
signal cautious risk management and improved asset quality, alongside a growing exposure to the 
public sector—which carries lower risk weights and may affect the extent of private sector lending. 
Banking sector profitability remains solid, with increases observed in both return on assets and 
equity. A loan-to-deposit ratio of 62 percent indicates sufficient liquidity buffers and a focus on 
stability rather than rapid credit expansion.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS 
9.       The outlook remains favorable. Growth 
and the external balance are primarily influenced by 
economic prospects in Ethiopia, which remain 
cautiously optimistic following the US announced 
revision of tariffs. This optimism stems from higher 
gold and coffee prices, the depreciation of the 
Ethiopian birr following exchange rate reforms, 
ongoing macroeconomic stabilization, and limited 
financial account exposure. The planned fiscal 
consolidation and reduced large-scale investments 
may somewhat temper the outlook. Overall, growth 
is projected to stay strong at around 6 percent this 
year, before moderating to 5½ percent over the medium term. Inflation is projected to ease to 
1.4 percent over the medium term, as core inflation declines alongside growth, and both food and 
energy inflation moderate in line with projected international prices. The current account surplus is 
expected to narrow to about 8 percent of GDP over the medium term, driven by re-exports to 
Ethiopia, moderation in secondary income, and ongoing imports growth related to port expansion 
and renewable energy projects. A reduction in government consumption (as a share of GDP), in line 
with the planned fiscal consolidation, is expected to result in positive reserves accumulation.

10.       Djibouti’s outlook faces several risks in an uncertain regional and global context 
(RAM). Renewed conflict in Tigray and worsening Ethiopia-Eritrea relations could increase refugee 
flows into Djibouti. Combined with reduced donor grants, this may strain food supplies and social 
conditions amid limited job creation and a constrained budget. A potential depreciation of the 
dollar and thus the Djiboutian franc would enhance the competitiveness of service exports, while 
increasing inflationary and/or fiscal pressures, depending on the extent of pass-through to domestic 
prices. Building fiscal space, better targeting social protection to the most vulnerable, and 
diversifying the economy would help mitigate these risks. Delays in fiscal consolidation, debt 
negotiations, and the development of the Berbera port in Somaliland, could lead to continued 
declines in foreign reserves. On the upside, expedited debt renegotiations, revenue mobilization, 
and stronger SOE governance, could help rebuild fiscal space and improve the economic outlook. 
Private sector investment may exceed expectations, supported by Djibouti’s stable economy, 
currency board, modern port infrastructure, and connectivity to Ethiopia's large market. 

Authorities’ Views 

11.       The authorities held a more optimistic view of the outlook. They anticipate higher 
growth rates of about 7 percent in the medium term, driven by stronger Ethiopian growth and 
imports, and private investment in energy, transport infrastructure and housing linked to real estate 
programs and progress on the National Development Plan 2020–24. They expected these factors to 
more than offset the significant fiscal consolidation planned. The authorities concurred with staff’s 

8 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

 
 
DJIBOUTI 

characterization of the risks to the outlook while emphasizing that Djibouti has successfully 
navigated several shocks in recent years, including COVID-19, the 2022 Tigray crisis, the Ukraine war, 
and the 2024 Red Sea maritime disruptions. They noted that an escalation of the current geopolitical 
tensions could jeopardize fiscal consolidation efforts by increasing security expenses and the fiscal 
costs associated with stabilizing fuel and food prices. 

POLICY DISCUSSIONS 
Amid high global uncertainty, Djibouti should strengthen its economic resilience by restoring debt 
sustainability, strengthening the currency board, and fostering inclusive growth. Sustaining fiscal 
consolidation, reforming SOEs and increasing their contributions to the national budget, renegotiating 
debt terms with major creditors, and securing new concessional financing, remain essential. Structural 
reforms to attract investment, diversify the economy, and generate formal jobs are also vital. 

A.   Fiscal Policies: Enhancing Fiscal Consolidation, Reforming SOEs, and 

Renegotiating Debt Terms  

12.       Despite continued fiscal consolidation, debt is projected to remain unsustainable. 
Amidst standing arrears and limited financing, the authorities plan to pursue their consolidation 
efforts, as highlighted in their 2024–27 fiscal reform Action Plan. Despite the anticipated fiscal 
tightening, which is expected to lead to a broadly balanced government position in the medium 
term, Djibouti’s overall and external public debt remain in debt distress and are unsustainable (Debt 
Sustainability Analysis, DSA) primarily due to outstanding arrears. 

•  Revenues. Projected non-tax revenues reflect gains from new military lease agreements. The 

macroeconomic framework also includes 0.2 percent of GDP of additional tax revenues in 2025 
(0.1 percent less than the authorities’ projection) and a cumulative 0.4 percent of GDP over 
2026–30, supported by the authorities' action plan. In 2025, direct, indirect taxation measures, 
and the digitalization of the payment of some taxes5, are expected to generate around 0.27, 
0.01, and 0.03 percent of GDP, respectively.6 The authorities’ action plan also includes land sales, 
stricter tax compliance controls, and additional staffing at the General Directory for Taxes to 
boost revenue collection. Over 2026–30, the authorities aim to leverage the extensive IMF and 
donor TA and establish a tax policy unit (TPU) to improve tax reform efficiency, finalize the 
digitalization and integration of information systems across tax administrations, and 
operationalize the recently created large taxpayer office (LTO). The authorities are planning to 
introduce additional SME, property, and VAT taxation measures. 

5 Electronic payment is now available for the vehicle road tax, the stamp duty and licensing fees. 

6 Direct and indirect taxation measures encompass the general business tax, the tax on professional profits, the tax 
on dividends, the tax on mobile money transfers and the VAT.

•  Expenditures. The projected consolidation entails primary current expenditure restraint. It involves 
a gradual reversal of fiscal overruns in goods and services contributing to Treasury overdrafts 
over the past two years, returning 2030 expenditure to 2022 levels, supported by stricter 
expenditure controls. The authorities’ 2024–27 action plan targets the following measures aimed 
at lowering non-essential current 
expenditures: reductions in water, phone, fuel, 
and electricity costs through meter checks and 
installing solar panels in public buildings; 
conducting an inventory to develop a plan to 
sell certain assets; restricting travel abroad; 
freezing contracts with non-essential 
providers; ensuring timely retirement for civil 
servants and promoting early, non-
replacement retirements; reviewing civil 
servants’ hiring and benefits; continuing the 
restructuring of the administrative public 
entities (EPAs, ¶18); and pausing lower-priority 
investments. The authorities have set quarterly caps on non-essential spending and monitor 
compliance digitally. The projections also assume that the public wage bill will keep declining (by 
about 0.1 percent of GDP annually), as it has for a decade.

13.       Achieving lasting fiscal consolidation through steadfast implementation, together with 
SOE reform and debt negotiations, is essential for restoring debt sustainability. The substantial 
fiscal adjustment frontloaded in the 2025 budget and the medium-term balanced budget target are 
welcome steps. Additional steps to safeguard fiscal consolidation, guard against implementation 
risks, and improve tax system efficiency include: 

•  Fiscal consolidation. On the revenue side (Annex I), this could encompass further expanding the 
capital income tax base, accurately costing major tax expenditures, significantly narrowing tax 
exemptions under the derogatory regimes, designing and implementing programs to promote 
voluntary compliance. Asset sales should prioritize their impact on public sector net worth over 
short-term cash generation. On the expenditure side, the effective implementation of the 
authorities’ 2024–27 action plan will require concerted efforts from all governmental entities, 
thorough expenditure monitoring by the Ministry of Budget, and the operationalization of the 
Treasury Single Account (TSA) along with improved cash forecasting to support timely 
adjustments if spending deviates from the budget. In addition, the authorities could consider 
phasing out fuel subsidies and expanding targeted cash transfers to households identified as 
most vulnerable, as this approach provides a more efficient and equitable alternative to existing 
fuel subsidies.  

•  SOE debt reduction and dividend mobilization. Accelerating SOE governance reforms (below) 

remains essential to unlock sustainable and meaningful dividend contributions to the national 
budget, while mitigating fiscal risks associated with SOEs, including through Public Private 

10 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

 
DJIBOUTI 

Partnerships (PPPs). The liquidation of the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) provides an 
opportunity to mobilize dividends from profitable SOEs. In addition, enforcing highly-indebted 
SOEs to gradually reduce their debt, mostly guaranteed by the government, would also help.  

14.       Alongside fiscal consolidation, finalizing debt negotiations, adopting a medium-term 
debt strategy, and enhancing fiscal governance are critical for debt sustainability.  

•  Finalizing debt negotiations with major 

creditors. As of end-2024, China was the 
country's primary creditor. The agreed 
debt service moratorium with Exim Bank 
China, which limits interest payments for 
the railway and water projects to about 
USD 20 million over 2024–27 (compared 
to USD 276 million previously), offers 
only temporary relief. The authorities 
aim to renegotiate debt terms with Exim 
Bank China in 2025. They also anticipate 
positive discussions with Exim Bank 
India and Paris club creditors.

•  Adopting a medium-term debt strategy and enhancing fiscal governance. The authorities plan to 
enact a new organic law on the financial regime of the state as part of the Strategy for the 
Reform of Public Financial Management, setting indicative golden rules on expenditures, 
revenues, fiscal balances and debt. A national strategy will also be developed to manage 
medium-term public debt and outline annual borrowing plans. In this context, the authorities 
should set a debt target with a multi-year fiscal deficit path and enforce borrowing limits for the 
central government, SOEs, including their participation in PPPs. The Public Sector Debt 
Committee, which issues reasoned opinions on any borrowing requests, should ensure prudent 
debt management. The Ministry of Budget should consistently assess the fiscal impact and risks 
of all PPP projects, as required by the current legal framework. Such a rules-based framework 
will help identify high-quality investment projects and strengthen planning and budgeting. 
Continuing reforms to enhance fiscal transparency and strengthen public financial management, 
as outlined in the approved Public Finance Management Reform Strategy, will help support debt 
sustainability.  

Authorities’ Views 

15.       The authorities concurred with the urgent need to mobilize revenue to create fiscal 
space and improve debt sustainability. They highlighted digitalizing tax administration, the TPU, 
LTO, organizing national tax conferences, and standardizing the VAT payment threshold as effective 
strategies for increasing revenue. They emphasized their focus on streamlining expenditures in 
contrast to ending tax exemptions, as they believed that the latter could affect Djibouti’s investment 
attractiveness. They stated their objective to maintain social equity in an environment susceptible to 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  11 

 
 
 
DJIBOUTI 

shocks. They highlighted that they were reviewing options to improve the targeting of the current 
fuel subsidy program, thereby decreasing the budget's exposure to changes in international energy 
prices. The authorities also emphasized that the government was planning to implement a new 
budget policy in 2026 to boost SOE dividend contributions, including from former SWF-managed 
entities, following the Organic Law for Public Finances and updated accounting and transparency 
standards. 

16.       The authorities acknowledged high debt levels and emphasized that they were taking 
steps to improve sustainability. They also noted that the current debt levels were attributable to 
substantial investments in two strategic sectors vital for the nation’s development: the drinking 
water sector, aimed at mitigating Djibouti’s persistent water stress, and the railway sector, designed 
to connect the country’s logistics platform to its primary market, Ethiopia. They also emphasized 
that within this framework, fiscal reforms introduced by the 2025 Finance Law, adjustments to 
military base rental agreements, and ongoing negotiations with major creditors were all intended to 
facilitate a long-term restructuring of the debt and promote its sustainability.  

B.   State-Owned Enterprise Governance Reform 

17.       Advancing SOE governance reform is essential for fiscal sustainability, limiting fiscal 
risks, and enhancing public services. Well-managed and profitable SOEs, which are integral to the 
Djiboutian economy, together with their contribution to the budget can significantly aid national 
fiscal consolidation and help restore reserves at the CBD, particularly following the dissolution of the 
SWF. At the same time, addressing the complex financial relations between the central government 
and some SOEs can strengthen SOEs’ ability to operate under commercial conditions.  

18.       The authorities are continuing to implement the code adopted in 2016 to enhance SOE 
governance.7 The Secrétariat Exécutif chargé du Portefeuille de l’État (SEPE) has established a 
register of all SOEs, begun training accountants and board members to enhance SOE financial 
information in line with IPSAS standards and governance, and completed the first phase of 
restructuring of administrative public entities (EPAs). This initial phase eliminated eight entities and 
consolidated twelve, reducing subsidies, streamlining support functions, and improving skills 
alignment. A second phase planned in 2026 will pursue deeper reform of these entities. 

19.       Additional measures are needed to strengthen SOE performance, monitoring, and 
contribution to the state. These include a gradual deleveraging of highly indebted SOEs, 
mobilizing dividends from profitable SOEs to the budget, limiting fiscal transfers to loss-making 
ones and restructuring or closing them to ensure the profitability of the sector. Key priorities 
include: 

7 The Code of Good SOE Governance seeks to improve efficiency, transparency and accountability by requiring SOE 
financial and performance data collection, establishing KPI-based management, strengthening board governance, 
and creating an ownership policy to guide state-SOE relations, including finances and dividends. 

12

DJIBOUTI 

• 

• 

In 2025, use the existing SOE governance structure8 to mandate timely disclosure of financial 
statements from all SOEs, including those formerly under the dissolved SWF, and expand KPI-
based performance contracts beyond the national water utility ‘Office National de l’Eau et de 
l’Assainissement de Djibouti’ (ONEAD) to advance SOE transformation. In addition, establish 
transparent dividend policies based on financial performance and finalize the review of SOE 
independent boards by implementing updated candidate qualification criteria 

In 2026, focus on finalizing implementation of the Code on Good SOE governance by reviewing 
the SOE portfolio to determine whether to retain, restructure, or divest each entity. Establishing 
a clear framework for the state’s financial interactions with SOEs would enable SOEs to operate 
commercially and prevent the future buildup of expenditure arrears to SOEs.  

Authorities’ Views 

20.       The authorities agreed to improve SOE transparency and accountability and clarify 
their economic role. They recognized that improved SOE governance was essential for effective 
state asset management, better public services, and reduced fiscal risks. In April 2025, a 
presidentially supported a campaign promoted SEPE’s role and the implementation of the Code of 
Good Governance in all ministries, while efforts to enhance professional requirements for board 
members continue. The authorities aim to train at least 70 leaders as SOE administrators by 2025. 
SEPE will collect data from all SOEs to improve financial transparency and review the SOE portfolio in 
2026 based on the KPI performance framework. They also plan to improve fiscal transparency and 
risk management through a shareholder policy clarifying financial relations between central 
government and SOEs and conducting regular audits. 

C.   Monetary and Financial Sector Policies 

21.       Strengthening the CBD law in line with the 2023 safeguards assessment 
recommendations would enhance CBD’s autonomy. Key amendments to reinforce CBD 
governance and the currency board include: (i) redefining the coverage ratio to encompass the 
monetary base and government deposits, reinforcing fiscal discipline; (ii) enhancing eligibility criteria 
for Board members by requiring expertise in financial institutions oversight; (iii) specifying the 
governing body responsible for appointing the external auditor; and (iv) enhancing financial 
statement transparency. In addition, safeguards recommendations on financial reporting, audit, risk 
management and internal controls should be implemented. Staff also recommends developing a 
reimbursement plan between the CBD and the Ministry of Budget to strengthen CBD’s balance 
sheet and deter further monetary financing. The CBD should use future profits to pay off 
outstanding overdrafts before distributing dividends, as allowed by its statutes.  

22.       Phasing in reserve requirements would further strengthen Djibouti’s currency board. 
Reserve requirements offset the absence of a deposit guarantee fund, stabilize FX reserves (by 

8 SOE governance is overseen by a steering committee led by the prime minister, with technical support from a 
committee chaired by the Minister of Finance. The Ministry of Finance supervises the SEPE, which monitors and 
implements the reform process.

generating yields on actively managed reserves), provide a liquidity buffer against shocks, and 
encourage an interbank market. Capacity development from METAC has supported the 
establishment of a dedicated unit for the preparation, implementation, and monitoring of reserves 
requirements. The BCD should finalize the draft regulation and adopt a phased approach in setting 
policy parameters that enhance liquidity management and reinforce the banking sector’s financial 
stability. 

23.       Implementing the MENAFATF recommendations will strengthen the AML/CFT 
framework. The 2024 Mutual Evaluation Report rated Djibouti as “Largely Compliant” and 
“Compliant” in 18 of the 40 recommendations, placing the country under "enhanced monitoring". 
The authorities are addressing areas where Djibouti is partially compliant or non-compliant—
particularly to protect international correspondent banking relationships. Measures to be 
implemented include strengthening customer due diligence, regulating virtual asset service 
providers, and enforcing sanctions for breaches related to terrorism financing.  

24.       Improving central bank oversight will help strengthen Djibouti's growing banking 
sector. The banking sector features a substantial offshore component and increasing exposure to 
the government, with total assets reaching USD 3½ billion (81½ percent of GDP) by the end of 
2024, underscoring the need for enhanced regulation and oversight. Building on advances in 
operational capacity, the CBD should continue implementing 2020 Financial Sector Stability Review 
(FSSR) recommendations, including liquidity coverage ratio reporting, establishing an internal audit 
function, and reviewing foreign exposure limits. 

Authorities’ Views 

25.       The CBD endorsed recommendations to amend its statutes, gradually introduce 
reserve requirements, enhance AML/CFT compliance, and strengthen financial sector 
oversight. The authorities acknowledged the need to accelerate safeguards assessment 
reforms—particularly, amending the CBD statutes to support the currency board regime—and 
plan to formally request TA from the Fund. The reserve requirements ratio is being finalized in 
consultation with commercial banks, and its implementation is expected to follow a phased 
approach. The authorities agreed to implement pending MENAFATF recommendations and aim to 
achieve full compliance by June 2026. 

D.   Structural Reforms  

26.       Accelerating reforms to foster private investment, diversify the economy, and create 
jobs remains essential. Building on previous infrastructure investments, Djibouti should continue 
economic transformation, modernize its public sector, and address informality. Under the Djibouti 
Vision 2035 framework, the government seeks to advance economic diversification across key 
sectors including logistics and connectivity, tourism, agribusiness, and fisheries. To enhance the 
business environment, it is essential to develop a roadmap with specific actions and timelines. 
Priority areas include:

14 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

 
DJIBOUTI 

•  Utilities services. Improve reliability and access and reduce the cost of electricity and 

telecommunication services, by continuing to expand cost-efficient green electricity generation 
and large international data connectors. Lower cost-recovery electricity tariffs to the private 
sector by improving bill collection (including from the public sector), simplifying tariff structure, 
modernizing and expanding the grid, and enhancing its technical efficiency (Box 1). 

• 

Level playing field. (i) Broaden the tax base by limiting tax exemptions in scope and duration, 
and unifying effective tax rates, removing market entry barriers; (ii) establish an SOE ownership 
strategy to determine which SOEs will remain public, undergo restructuring, or be divested. 

•  Market regulation and human capital. (i) Streamline administrative procedures and improve 
access to finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME), to encourage creation of 
formal businesses and employment; (ii) safeguard fiscal space to invest in health and education 
and improve workforce skills by effectively implementing the national education masterplan 
(2021–35). 

27.       Continuous improvements in statistical coverage and quality will help enhance 
evidence-based policy making. Djibouti’s data submitted to the Fund for surveillance are assessed 
as having some shortcomings that somewhat hamper surveillance, which corresponds to a “C” 
overall rating under the Data Adequacy Assessment (DAA) (Annex IV). Monetary and financial 
statistics have some shortcomings but are overall adequate for surveillance. National Accounts (NA) 
data offer detailed insight into GDP by activity and expenditure. With IMF TA support, Djibouti's 
recent adoption of the Enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS) and publication of 
the National Data Summary Page (NDSP) will enable more frequent and timely NA dissemination. 
Fiscal data are reported according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 1986 
standards and encompass only the central government budget. The authorities furnish information 
on SOE dividends, publicly guaranteed debt, and arrears, aiding fiscal stance and debt sustainability 
assessments, though PPPs still pose fiscal risks. Improved goods statistics and accurate recording of 
financial account transactions related to re-exports proceeds can help reduce net errors and 
omissions (NEOs) (Box 2). The authorities have outlined plans to develop an international 
transactions reporting system (ITRS) with support from IMF TA to address these matters.  

Authorities’ Views 

28.       The authorities recognized the need to accelerate structural reforms to enhance 
economic diversification, growth, and job creation in line with Vision 2035. They emphasized 
their commitment to strengthening Djibouti’s human capital through a 2021–35 education 
masterplan focused on ensuring universal, high-quality primary and secondary education for all 
children, including refugees, by investing in schools, teachers, teaching practices, and job training. 
They highlighted that Djibouti was expanding its telecom infrastructure, with Djibouti Telecom 
providing mobile and data services to over 95 percent of the population and covering 80 percent of 
the country. They also stated that the authorities were working with the World Bank and other 
donors to reduce electricity consumption in government facilities and to expand the generation and 
distribution capacity of green electricity.

Box 1. Djibouti: Affordable and Reliable Electricity to Foster Investment and Growth 

Djibouti Vision 2035 outlines an ambitious path toward 
economic diversification and sustainable growth, with 
electricity being foundational in enabling this 
transformation. As the country seeks to expand sectors 
such as information and communication technology, 
transport and logistics, tourism, fishing, and mining, the 
demand for reliable and affordable electricity is 
expected to rise. While current per capita electricity 
consumption is in line with LIC peers, realizing Vision 
2035 will necessitate a significant scale-up in electricity 
production and access, as these sectors are energy-
intensive. 

The electricity sector currently faces several structural challenges that limit Djibouti’s growth potential and 
inclusiveness: 

o  Significant tariff-cost misalignment may 

discourage productive investment. The average 
sales price stands at 29 US cents per kWh, which is 
among the highest globally and nearly triple the 
estimated supply cost of 9–11 US cents per kWh, 
reflecting low-cost hydropower imports from 
Ethiopia and domestic renewable sources like the 
Ghoubet Wind Farm. The pricing structure, 
compounded by a complex tariff system, makes 
electricity costs as high as 25 percent of operating 
expenses for businesses.  

o  Insufficient payments from public sector clients 

lead to reduced revenues for the national electricity company, and the need to charge higher tariffs to 
other clients to safeguard financial viability. 

o  Large clients such as ports and military bases are increasingly turning to self-generation via solar 

installations and other solutions, leading to grid fragmentation.  

o  Despite a steady increase in the number of subscribers, over one-third of the population remained 

unconnected to the national grid as of 2022, with rural communities particularly affected.  

To address these challenges, a range of measures may be considered to unlock the electricity sector’s full 
potential as a catalyst for inclusive and sustainable growth. First, expanding grid access and investing in last-
mile connectivity are essential for equitable energy distribution. Second, simplifying the tariff structure based 
on cost recovery can help maintain financial sustainability, with more competitive rates for productive 
sectors encouraging investment and job creation. Finally, improving payment discipline—especially in the 
public sector—can strengthen the financial viability of the electricity utility and enable targeted subsidies or 
infrastructure upgrades.

Box 2. Djibouti: External Sector Statistics 

Starting with the 2025 Article IV consultation, Djibouti’s data submitted to the Fund for surveillance are 
assessed based on the DAA framework (Annex IV).  A main challenge encountered in the compilation of 
Djibouti’s ESS is their consistency, evidenced by the large BOP NEOs, reaching up to 31 percent of GDP over 
2013–24. A significant proportion of these NEOs reflects the recording of re-exports primarily to Ethiopia 
(representing over 90 percent of Djibouti’s goods exports) and their settlement handled by Ethiopian 
importers. A primary challenge arises when matching imports each year and re-exports in the same year, as 
imports may be re-exported several months later (which sometimes leads to a different year) for different 
reasons. High re-exports and related valuation effects have contributed to heightened volatility in the 
current account balance, ranging from -30.8 percent of GDP in 2013 to 14.1 percent of GDP in 2024.   

Furthermore, challenges in fully accounting for re-export proceeds from Ethiopia, some of which are paid 
through informal channels, are recorded in NEOs. This suggests that inflows of funds are understated or that 
some outflows of funds are overstated. While Customs seems to accurately record trade activity in the free 
trade zone, further clarity is needed to understand the settlement of re-exports. In this regard, a better 
understanding of the activities of the free trade zone enterprises and their transactions with banks could 
shed some light on the discrepancy between the current and the financial accounts. 

Djibouti shares economic traits with countries like Belize, Cabo Verde, and Comoros—such as per capita 
income, reliance on ports, close ties to a larger neighbor, and small state status. The collective experience 
with ESS compilation in these countries indicates that Djibouti has made strides in improving the periodicity 
and timeliness of its BOP compilation, including the IIP. Increasing full-time staff for ESS could further 
enhance follow-up with source data providers and the investigation of NEOs.    

29.       The authorities welcomed staff recommendations to improve statistics with IMF TA. 
They believed that launching e-GDDS and publishing the NSDP will help Djibouti meet 
recommended data dissemination standards and improve its DAA score, especially by improving the 
frequency and timeliness of NA releases. The authorities observed that the evaluation of data quality 
indicated inconsistencies in the government finance and external sector statistics, which have 
impacted the overall DAA consistency score. They agreed to incorporate SOEs into government 
finance statistics and plan to work towards the adoption of GFSM 2014, with IMF TA support, aiming 
for greater transparency in government-SOE financial flows. They acknowledged the low DAA 
consistency rating, partly due to significant BOP NEOs, and expressed their intention to investigate 
the source further with TA from the IMF. 

STAFF APPRAISAL 
30.       Djibouti is positioned to leverage its economic resilience to tackle fiscal and 
development challenges. Djibouti has handled recent shocks well, maintaining solid growth 
despite Red Sea tensions, with moderate inflation and rising reserves. Logistics investments over the 
past decade have boosted growth and economic transformation but increased external debt, leaving 
limited fiscal space considering development needs. In a challenging global climate, the authorities’ 
focus on macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability, and economic diversification to support job 
creation is commendable. 

31.       Growth stays robust amid regional conflicts. Economic growth is expected to have 
surpassed 6½ percent of GDP in 2024, driven by higher transshipment activity alongside robust 
expansion in the construction, commerce, telecommunications and tourism sectors. Moderation in 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  17 

 
 
 
DJIBOUTI 

international food and energy prices has contributed to keeping inflation contained. In 2024, 
substantial fiscal consolidation was realized, which aided in rebuilding reserves and partially offset 
the decline seen since late 2023; however, reserve levels remain below the monetary base. The 
authorities’ plan to maintain strong fiscal consolidation, aiming for a government surplus this year 
and a balanced budget in the medium term, is welcome. 

32.       The outlook is positive but faces risks amid global uncertainty. Growth is projected to 
remain strong at about 6 percent in 2025, then to stabilize near 5½ percent in the medium term, 
largely driven by Ethiopia’s strong demand for port services. Inflation is projected to remain 
subdued in line with global energy and food prices. External risks include heightened instability in 
the Horn of Africa with increased migration potentially straining social conditions amid constrained 
fiscal space, reduced development aid, new competition from nearby ports, and global policy shifts 
possibly weakening the dollar and Djibouti franc, spurring service exports but raising inflation.  

33.       Djibouti needs to restore debt sustainability and rebuild reserves through a mix of 
fiscal consolidation, SOE reform, and debt negotiations. Clearing all arrears and finalizing debt 
negotiations is key to restore debt sustainability, alongside the containment of public and publicly 
guaranteed debt through quantified and enforced ceilings on both SOE and central government 
debt. This should be complemented by durable fiscal consolidation. To sustain progress, it is 
imperative to ensure the effective implementation of the revenue and expenditure measures 
outlined in the authorities’ 2024–27 Action Plan for fiscal reforms as well as rationalize tax 
expenditures associated with the derogatory regimes. 

34.       Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to accelerate SOE governance reform. 
Swiftly implementing the Code of Good SOE Governance, including by collecting financial 
statements from all SOEs to allow performance monitoring, together with enforcing a transparent 
dividend policy, and gradually deleveraging those highly indebted, will contribute to achieving debt 
sustainability. In addition, staff encourages the authorities to review the SOE portfolio to determine 
whether to retain, restructure, or divest each entity to improve the efficiency of the sector. The 
authorities should also apply a market-based approach to financial settlement practices between 
SOEs and the state.  

35.       Building on the recent recovery in reserves, the authorities should pursue a 
comprehensive strategy to strengthen the currency board. Alongside amending the CBD law to 
enhance its autonomy and implementing reserve requirements incrementally, the CBD should retain 
future CBD profits to further bolster reserves. Furthermore, sustaining fiscal consolidation and 
leveraging dividends from profitable SOEs, including ex-SWF entities, remain essential measures to 
prevent the recurrence of overdrafts. Developing a reimbursement plan with the Ministry of Budget 
would help clarify arrangements to strengthen reserves. 

36.       Speeding up reforms to boost private investment, diversify the economy, and create 
jobs would further support the authorities’ commitment to inclusive growth. Leveling the 
playing field between companies operating under the general and special regimes, and lowering 
electricity costs by curbing government agencies' overuse and improving bill collection, will buttress 
Djibouti’s investment momentum. Enhancing SME financing and strengthening education and job 

18 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

 
DJIBOUTI 

training under the 2021–35 education master plan is essential for private sector growth and the 
effective implementation of the ‘Vision 2035’ national development strategy. 

37.       High quality data coverage will support policy making and strengthen surveillance. 
The authorities have taken important steps to improve the dissemination and quality of 
macroeconomic statistics and are determined to further improve the coverage and consistency of 
national, fiscal, and external accounts data in line with DAA requirements. Advancements in data 
compilation methods and the timely publication of statistics will further enhance economic analysis 
and policy making.  

38.       Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Djibouti be held on the 
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Djibouti Reforms to Mobilize Revenues 

DJIBOUTI 

At about 11 percent in 2024, Djibouti’s tax-

1. 
to-GDP ratio is several percentage points below 
the 15 to 16 percent averages observed in other 
lower middle-income countries, or in non-oil 
exporters in the MENA and sub-Saharan Africa.1 It 
is also below the 12¾ percent of GDP threshold, 
which the empirical literature shows is linked to 
improved economic growth and development.2 
Djibouti's declining tax ratio since 2015 suggests 
room for enhanced tax design and administration. To 
support revenue mobilization, staff has provided TA in 
the following areas:

•  Tax Policy Unit. The objective is to support institution building and the implementation of 

sustained and meaningful tax reforms over the medium-term by creating and fully 
operationalizing a dedicated tax policy unit.  

•  Tax policy reform. The aim is to generate equitable revenues in a fair and efficient manner, 
while ensuring simplicity in administration and compliance. Key reform areas include:  

o  Direct taxation. (I) Income tax on salaries: Revise rates to enhance progressivity; properly 

account for in-kind benefits; initiate discussions on taxing pensions; (II) Tax on professional 
profits: Broaden the tax base by eliminating tax exemptions, while offering more targeted 
and cost-efficient incentives within the tax code (e.g., longer loss carry-forwards, investment 
tax credits with sunset clauses); simplify taxation for small businesses by removing 
exemptions and introducing a presumptive regime based on turnover for businesses below 
the VAT threshold; tax rental income and capital earned by businesses under the 
professional profits tax; (III) Other direct taxes: Introduce a moderate tax on investment 
income; implement a new rental income tax; reform the property tax system by moving away 
from using rental values as the tax base; eliminate the patente, with corresponding 
adjustments to other taxes to make up for the revenue loss.  

o 

Indirect taxation. (I) VAT: Increase VAT threshold; eliminate poorly-targeted VAT exemptions; 
refrain from offering VAT exemptions as investment incentives, conditional on improving the 
efficient processing of VAT refunds; (II) Consumption tax: Replace the TIC with a customs 
tariff with a coherent rate structure; improve the transparency of the prevailing tariff 
structure and remove customs duty exemptions without legal basis; and (III) Use excise taxes

as instruments to correct for externalities (and possibly improve progressivity in the case of 
motor vehicles); consider using both ad valorem and specific duties on some goods 
(tobacco, alcohol sugary drinks); consolidate the various levies on khat to enhance 
transparency and improve policy coherence.    

•  Tax expenditures. The objective is to improve the quality of the tax expenditures report 

through (i) addressing data access, coverage, including systematic evaluation of all major tax 
exemptions, and clearer governance and enforcement mechanisms and (ii) updating the list of 
tax expenditures to expand coverage while avoiding misclassifications.  

•  Tax administration. The aim is to increase the efficiency and enhance voluntary compliance. 
This can be achieved by (i) strengthening the performance of the newly established Large 
Taxpayers Directorate (LTO), (ii) reducing taxpayer compliance costs through the simplification 
and modernization of procedures—particularly via the introduction of electronic filing for large 
enterprises—professionalizing tax administration staff, and improving taxpayer services, and 
(iii) modernizing of Djibouti’s customs code to align with the COMESA framework, the WCO 
Revised Kyoto Convention, and the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. Additionally, developing 
a robust stakeholder engagement and communication strategy will be essential to foster trust 
and encourage cooperative relationships between the tax administration and taxpayers. 

•  Tax expenditures. The objective is to improve the quality of the tax expenditures report 

through (I) addressing data access, coverage, including systematic evaluation of all major tax 
exemptions, and clearer governance and enforcement mechanisms and (II) updating the list of 
tax expenditures to expand coverage while avoiding misclassifications.  

Djibouti’s 2024–27 Action Plan under the Reform of Public Financial Management foresees the 
operationalization of the LTO, the simplification of the taxation for small businesses with a synthetic 
regime based on turnover, the standardization of the threshold for companies to have to pay VAT to 
DJF 50 million, and the replacement of the consumption tax by a customs tariff in line with COMESA 
standards.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment 

Overall Assessment: Djibouti’s external position in 2024 was substantially stronger than what is justified by fundamentals 
and desirable policies. The EBA Lite Model shows a current account gap of 18.6 percent of GDP, suggesting a REER 
undervaluation of 18.8 percent. On the other hand, the REER index model indicates an overvaluation of 1.5 percent of GDP, 
implying a current account gap of 1.5 percent. Both assessments are subject to considerable uncertainty given statistical 
challenges. Reexports to Ethiopia play a key role in Djibouti’s current account, comprising of 92.6 percent of export goods 
and 93.6 percent of import goods in 2024. Reserves are below the IMF’s 3 months of imports threshold. 

Potential Policy Responses: The real effective exchange rate remained stable in 2024, with the currency board providing 
essential confidence and predictability in international transactions. However, Djibouti’s economy features low import and 
export price elasticities, indicating substantial potential for enhancing external competitiveness through structural reforms, 
reducing internal costs (particularly in electricity and telecommunications) and increasing investment in health and 
education. Strengthening foreign exchange reserves by diversifying exports, enhancing port competitiveness through high-
yield projects, and improving fiscal discipline will further support the currency board. Improving the quality of external 
sector statistics is critical to allow for more precise analysis of the external sector position.   

Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory 
Background. Djibouti’s net international investment position stood 
at –83.7 percent of GDP in 2024, compared to –82.8 percent of GDP 
in 2023, reflecting debt and direct investment inflows for the 
construction of the trade hub over the past decade. Gross external 
assets stood at about 53 percent of GDP in 2024, after reaching 
54½ percent in 2022, reflecting mainly foreign assets of deposit-
taking corporations, which channel a large share of the domestic 
deposit base to overseas affiliates. Gross liabilities stood at about 
136.7 percent of GDP, with external public and publicly guaranteed 
debt amounting to 62.8 percent of GDP. The stock of foreign direct 
investment accounted for the rest. From 2019 to 2024, liabilities rose 
by 35.4 percent. The country’s net external position is anticipated to 
stabilize as the pace of infrastructure projects decreases.

Assessment. Djibouti’s net debtor position has weakened on the back of large increases in public and publicly 
guaranteed external debt service. The debt service moratorium agreed with Exim Bank China, effective until 2027, has 
supported an improvement, but the sizable external public debt presents risks to external sector sustainability.  
2024 (% GDP)  NIIP: -83.7  Gross Assets: 53 
Current Account 
Background. The headline current account has been strongly positive over the past year (with an estimated surplus of 
14.2 percent of GDP in 2024), in part because available data indicate significantly higher reexports compared to imports 
for reexports of goods, although this is accompanied by considerable errors and omissions. Exports of services 
increased by 6.1 percent while imports of services declined by 7 percent.  

Gross Lib.:  -136.7 

Debt Assets:  6.7 

Debt Lib.:  -68.4 

Assessment. The CA model finds a positive current account gap in 2024 of 18.6 percent, implying that the external 
position was substantially stronger than the level implied by fundamentals. It also shows a CA norm of –4.0 percent of 
GDP against a cyclically adjusted CA of 14.6 percent of GDP (Table 1). The policy gap is assessed at 2.6 percent of GDP, 
resulting from a combination of a lower public health expenditure and private credit, compared to desirable policies. 
Nevertheless, the shortcomings in BoP statistics, including large errors and omissions, suggest uncertainty.

DJIBOUTI 

Real Exchange Rate 
Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) remained stable in 2024, with a minor increase of 3 percent. 
Djibouti’s nominal effective exchange rate appreciated over the past decade, reflecting the relative strength of the 
U.S. dollar to which the Djibouti franc is pegged.  

Assessment. The REER Index model implies a CA gap of –1.5 percent, equivalent to an overvaluation of about 
1.5 percent in 2024. On the other hand, the CA model implies a REER gap of -18.8 percent, a sizable undervaluation. 
These assessments are subject to statistical uncertainty.  

Capital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures 
Background. Djibouti’s capital and financial account inflows are dominated by long-term official financing and FDI 
inflows. Outflows represent the reduction of foreign assets by the banking system, which reached US$187million in 
2024. Djibouti maintains open capital account policies.  

Assessment. Capital and financial account flows in Djibouti appear sustainable under the debt service moratorium. An 
accumulation of net foreign assets would increase buffers in the event of adverse shocks.   

FX Intervention and Reserves Level 
Background. Official reserves are a function of capital inflows, rental income from military bases and the demand for 
franc-denominated assets. Reserve adequacy in the context of the currency board is best measured by the coverage 
ratio. As of 2024, Djibouti’s international reserves cover 2.4 months of next year’s imports when imports for reexports 
are excluded, below the 3-months of imports standard threshold.  

Assessment. Reserve coverage at 117.2 percent continues to support the currency in circulation. However, a substantial 
increase in reserves is needed in the short term to fully cover the monetary base.

The data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance.

The data provided to the Fund have some shortcomings but are broadly adequate for surveillance.

The data provided to the Fund have some shortcomings that somewhat hamper surveillance.

The data provided to the Fund have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.

Rationale for staff assessment. Overall, the data provided to the Fund has shortcomings that somewhat hamper surveillance. Monetary and financial 
statistics (MFS) have some shortcomings but are broadly adequate for surveillance. There are insufficiencies in the National Accounts (NA), Goverment 
Finance Statistics (GFS) and External Sector Statistics (ESS) that somewhat hamper surveillance. NA: Data on NA provide granularity for GDP by economic 
activity and expenditure. NA data are typically released with a delay of up to 12 months. The release of the 2024 data was postponed on an ad hoc basis 
due to accommodate priority census activities. The use of 2013 as the base year somewhat limits the precision of current economic assessments. Prices: 
Data on inflation are published on the website of INSTAD (the statistics office) monthly and are granular. GFS: Fiscal data are reported according to the 
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 1986 standards and encompass only the central government budget. The authorities furnish information on 
SOE dividends, publicly guaranteed debt, and arrears, aiding fiscal stance and debt sustainability assessments, though PPPs still pose fiscal risks. Debt data 
are granular but they do not include SOEs' domestic debt. There have sometimes been some inconsistencies between the fiscal and debt file. ESS: The BOP 
and IIP data provided by the Central Bank of Djibouti has some shortcomings that somewhat hamper surveillance. While the authorities do not submit a 
granular breakdown of goods trade, they provide a detailed breakdown of services exports and imports, which are critical to Djibouti's port-dependent 
economy. Better tracking of reexports proceeds could reduce the large net errors and omissions; however, rail and road traffic data to Ethiopia provided by 
the authorities serve as good proxies for monitoring reexports. Some data gaps need to be addressed, especially in the financial account, "other 
investments", to reduce the discrepancy between the BOP and the IIP. MFS: Data provided to the fund are sufficiently comprehensive for the team’s analysis 
of the Monetary Policy Stance. FSI data provided are adequate for the team’s analysis of financial stability risks. Data on reserves and its components, critical 
under the currency board arrangement, are adequately provided.

Changes since the last Article IV consultation: BOP and IIP data were provided in a timely manner compared to last year when estimates had to be made. 
There has been no changes regarding the NA, GFS or MFS. The National Summary Data Page (NSDP) was launched under the e-GDDS

Corrective actions and capacity development priorities. Technical assistance from STA is supporting the authorities' transition from GFSM 1986 to GFSM 
2014 with plans to extend beyond the central government. METAC will also support the production and publication of quarterly national accounts. Capacity 
development should prioritize enhancing the coverage and the granularity of the balance of payments statistics, as well as ensuring the consistency between 
the BOP and the IIP. A GFS mission on the transition to GFSM 2014 is scheduled in Fall 2025 and a National Accounts mission on quarterly accounts in 
November 2025. An ESS mission is scheduled in April 2026. No MFS mission is planned. 

Use of data and/or estimates in Article IV consultations in lieu of official statistics available to staff. PortsWatch data, though not essential for 
surveillance or addressing delays in GDP reporting, may provide a preliminary indication of port activities at the beginning of a shock or crisis. PortsWatch 
uses satellite-based vessel data from the UN Global Platform, to provide real-time indicators of port and trade activity for 1730 ports and 24 chokepoints 
around the world. 

Other data gaps. The authorities are improving employment data. Staff will assesss labor market data availability in upcoming missions.

Annex V. Engagement Strategy with Djibouti 

Djibouti is a small economy which faces four main challenges (i) mobilizing revenue and 

1. 
restoring debt sustainability; (ii) strengthening financial oversight and the currency board; 
(iii) creating a more inclusive and resilient growth model; and (iv) capacity constraints, notably in the 
production and dissemination of statistics and economic information in general. To support the 
authorities in tackling these four challenges, the engagement strategy with Djibouti relies on close 
integration between surveillance and extensive capacity development.   

Support on revenue mobilization and debt management involves both FAD and 

2. 
METAC experts (see dedicated box), alongside close coordination through periodic round 
tables with other partners (AFD, AfDB, the EU, JICA, UNDP and the World Bank). Revenue 
mobilization is intended at creating fiscal space to restore debt sustainability and increase spending 
on health and education to create the human capital necessary to build a more inclusive and 
resilient growth model. During the MCD-led roundtable of March 2025, partners committed to 
enhancing coordination through an implementation matrix designed by staff. This aims to avoid 
overlapping, maximize impact, and ensure that the TA provided aligns with absorption capacity. 

TA in monetary and financial sector has been designed to align with Djibouti’s 

3. 
currency regime and banking system features. This support prioritized the strengthening of 
banking regulation and supervision with the appointment of an LTX for a two-year term (which 
ended in FY25). In addition, TA adapted to evolving needs, aiding the CBD in swiftly passing legal 
amendments during the MENAFATF evaluation process. Recently, there has been a concerted effort 
to enhance the legislative framework governing the currency board, particularly in response to signs 
of fiscal dominance observed since 2023.  

4. 
Capacity is a significant challenge in Djibouti which, like most small development 
states, lacks skills or resources in critical areas. Extensive technical assistance is provided to 
improve the quality and timeliness of statistics, including balance of payment statistics, monetary 
and financial statistics and government finance statistics. Support is also provided to help 
government officials access Fund trainings, particularly in priority areas like the analysis of debt 
sustainability or debt management.  

Support on structural reforms relies on analytical work captured in Staff Report’s 

5. 
boxes, annexes or Selected Issues Papers, on subjects critical for the countries, including SOE 
governance, economic diversification, job creation or financial inclusion.

Annex VI. Capacity Development Strategy 

Capacity development (CD) should focus on (i) supporting revenue mobilization through improved tax 
policy, revenue administration, public financial management and medium-term debt management; 
(ii) amending the BCD’s law to strengthen the central bank’s independence and fortify the currency 
board; (iii) implementing the recommendations of the MENAFATF evaluation; and (iv) increasing data 
timeliness, coverage, and quality of balance of payments and government finance statistics. In all these 
areas TA should also aim to build capacity. CD should remain closely integrated with surveillance.  

Fiscal sector technical assistance (TA) should focus support on revenue mobilization. 

1. 
TA from FAD and METAC should, in close coordination with the country team, support the 
authorities’ implementation efforts in tax policy, revenue administration and public financial 
management to reverse the declining trend in the tax-to-GDP ratio observed over the past decade. 
Priorities include the implementation of the large taxpayer office, budget preparation, the tax policy 
unit, and assessing and managing fiscal risks of SOEs. TA should assist the authorities in designing 
and implementing a medium-term debt management strategy, focusing on: (i) training relevant staff 
in debt portfolio management; (ii) developing a medium-term debt management strategy and an 
Annual Borrowing Plan; (iii) strengthening the legal and institutional framework for debt 
management by enhancing the coordination of debt management operations and creating a 
manual of procedures to support the national debt committee; and (iv) fostering the development 
of the domestic market for government securities. Additionally, TA will be closely coordinated with 
partners, including the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union (EU), the French 
Development Agency, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank. 

The Central bank’s TA should focus on the timely amendment of its statutes and the 

2. 
implementation of recommendations from the MENAFATF evaluation. The BCD should, in 
collaboration with IMF staff, prepare and submit to the Cabinet the necessary amendments to align 
with the safeguards assessment. This initiative will enhance the financial and institutional autonomy 
of the central bank while reinforcing the currency board arrangement. Furthermore, the authorities, 
under the auspices of LEG TA, should implement the recommendations of the MENAFATF evaluation 
report, particularly in areas where compliance is partial or lacking, such as the oversight of virtual 
assets and the enforcement of sanctions. 

TA should prioritize enhancing the timeliness, coverage, and consistency of external 

3. 
sector and government finance statistics (ESS). Addressing delays in transmitting BoP and IIP 
data to the country team and STA will improve data reliability. In addition, broadening data 
coverage and granularity—including compiling key components of the services account—will 
strengthen analytical capacity. TA should support BCD efforts in enhancing data sources, ensuring 
internal consistency, and aligning BoP and IIP methodologies. Strengthening the BoP service with 
increased staffing and targeted training is essential for sustaining long-term statistical capacity. TA 
in government finance statistics (GFS) should aid the authorities in transitioning from GFSM 1986 to 
GFSM 2014. Once this transition is complete, the next step should be to expand the coverage of 

38 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

 
 
GFS, which currently encompasses only the central government budget, to include SOEs. These SOEs 
significantly influence the Djiboutian economy and pose considerable fiscal risks to the central 
government budget.

Safeguards Assessment 

A safeguards assessment update of the Banque Centrale de Djibouti (BCD) was completed in August 
2023. It found that the BCD needs to strengthen governance arrangements, amend the BCD Law to 
reinforce autonomy, and enhance the transparency of the financial statements through the adoption of 
IFRS and the timely publication of audited financial statements. Furthermore, the internal audit and the 
risk management functions are not yet operational. The capacity constraints of the BCD contribute to 
weak controls in many areas such as currency management. While initial steps were taken to address 
these recommendations, the progress of implementation has been slow and concerted efforts are 
needed. 

Exchange arrangements 
Djibouti’s exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The Djibouti franc is pegged to the U.S. 
dollar at the rate of DJF 177.721 = US$1. Djibouti has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, 
Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of 
payments and transfers for current international transactions and multiple currency practices. 

Article IV Consultation 

On March, 22 2024 the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the 2024 Article IV consultation with 
Djibouti (IMF Country Report No. 24/59). 

FSAP Participation 

A Financial Sector Stability Review (FSSR) was completed in January 2020. The FSSR identified the 
following shortcomings: (i) banks’ large foreign exposures with uncertain liquidity profiles exacerbate 
banks’ risk profiles; (ii) few banks have locally designed liquidity risk management frameworks 
(including formalized liquidity risk appetite, tolerance, limits and contingency plans to address liquidity 
and funding shortfalls under stress); (iii) the absence of a CBD system wide liquidity monitoring; (iv) 
CBD 2013 instruction on liquidity has been suspended; and (iv) there is no Liquidity Coverage 
Framework in place. The CBD is in the process of addressing these shortcomings and was supported by 
an FSSR follow-up TA program, which included a resident advisor placed by MCM in 2022-2024.

Application of judgment

Unsustainable 
No 

Djibouti’s overall and external public debt is assessed to be in distress and unsustainable. 
This assessment reflects the accumulation of sizeable external arrears and protracted 
breaches of the sustainability thresholds of the present value (PV) of overall and external 
debt-to-GDP, as well as the external debt service-to-revenues ratios. The Debt 
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests that Djibouti is susceptible to exports and 
depreciation shocks; more prolonged and protracted shocks to the economy would also 
pose downside risks to the debt outlook.1  

The fiscal outlook has improved compared to a year ago, driven by an increase in revenues 
from military leases and the fiscal consolidation efforts undertaken in 2024. These factors, 
along with the moratorium with Exim Bank China, effective through 2027, create 
temporary fiscal space and help prevent the further accumulation of arrears. Additionally, 
the recent dissolution of the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) presents an opportunity to 
significantly increase the dividends paid by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to the central 
government budget. 

However, finalization of debt negotiations with major creditors, strengthened SOE 
governance, continued fiscal consolidation and new concessional financing remain 
essential to entrench debt sustainability. As the authorities continue their negotiations 
with major creditors to clear arrears and restructure debt, they should strive for a medium-
term debt strategy with explicit ceilings encompassing all public and publicly guaranteed 
debt, ambitious revenue mobilization and SOE dividend payments to the budget. 

1 Djibouti’s current composite indicator (CI) is 2.10, which corresponds to a weak debt-carrying capacity, as 
confirmed by the April 2025 World Economic Outlook assumptions and the 2023 World Bank’s Country Policy 
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).

PUBLIC DEBT COVERAGE  

 The coverage of public debt used for this DSA is public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) 

1.      
debt (Text Table 1). Specifically, the debt stock covers central government debt and government 
guarantees on external debt of SOEs. Data on non-guaranteed external debt held by SOEs is not 
available and therefore standard assumptions are used. Information on domestic debt remains 
partial.2 Domestic debt contracted by the central government is covered by the authorities’ data 
(and hence included in this DSA) and remains small.3 SOEs’ domestic debt is not captured. With 
support from the World Bank, the authorities have enhanced debt transparency since 2022 by 
regularly publishing information on all new or restructured public or publicly guaranteed loans, 
including those extended to SOEs.

2.       This DSA applies a tailored stress test on contingent liabilities. The tailored stress test on 
contingent liabilities amounts to 16.2 percent of GDP, which consists of four components: (i) the USD 200 
million awarded to DP world by a US court in July 2024 (5 percent of GDP), (ii) the materialization of 
potential additional SOE external liabilities at the default value (2 percent of GDP); (iii) the materialization 
of potential additional public and private partnerships (PPPs) contingent liabilities (4.2 percent of GDP); 
and (iv) a financial sector contingent liability at the default value (5 percent of GDP). 

BACKGROUND  

Debt accumulated rapidly between 2013 and 2024 as Djibouti expanded its role as 

3. 
port to Ethiopia and a regional hub for trade and logistics. Debt-to-GDP increased from 
34.9 percent in 2013 to 68.9 percent by the end of 2024. This rise was primarily driven by major 
infrastructure projects, including the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, the construction of the Doraleh

multi-purpose port and the Port of Ghoubet, 
as well as a water pipeline from Ethiopia. 
These projects were financed through loans 
contracted in 2013 from Exim Bank China, 
totaling USD 1.2 billion (approximately 
59 percent of GDP). In 2023, the public sector 
incurred additional borrowing amounting to 
about 8 percent of GDP. This included (i) a 
EUR 79.2 million loan contracted by the 
central government from the European 
Investment Bank (EIB) to support water 
desalination, improve access to clean drinking 
water, and enhance wastewater treatment and 
(ii) government guarantees extended for loans 
contracted by the State-Owned Enterprise Great Horn Investment Holding for two projects: USD 120 
million with Afreximbank and USD 35 million with Banque pour le Commerce et l’Industrie Mer 
Rouge (BCIMR) aimed at further developing the Damerjog Industrial Development Free Trade Zone 
and USD 95.5 million from Invest International for the development of the Ship Repair Yard.  There 
was no further borrowing in 2024. The authorities plan to borrow EUR 79.2 million more from the 
EIB in 2025, to further support water desalination, improve access to clean drinking water, and 
enhance wastewater treatment.

4.       Following significant non-concessional borrowing during a period of high interest rates, 
debt service costs have increased. The share of external debt at variable interest rates also increased. 
The construction and railway electrification loans were tied to the LIBOR, thus increasing exposure to 
global financing conditions. Driven by this and by more recent and planned new commercial loans 
from Afreximbank, Invest International and the EIB, the last two tied to EURIBOR, the weighted-average 
interest rate on Djibouti’s external debt stock is projected to rise from 1 percent in 2024 to an average 
of 2 percent over the ten-year projection horizon.   

5.       Due to the expiration of debt relief initiatives after the pandemic, debt service 
increased sharply in 2022, coinciding with a growth slowdown linked to the conflict in 
Ethiopia. The Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) and the Debt Service Suspension 
Initiative (DSSI) decreased debt service in 2020–21 and restructured arrears. The first round of the 
DSSI rescheduled debt service of about 2 percent of GDP in 2020 and the second round provided 
further relief of about 1.6 percent in 2021.

leading to arrears accumulation. As of end December 
2024, the total stock of arrears reached around 3 percent of 
GDP (2.2 percent for principal repayments and 0.7 percent

different creditors4: Exim Bank India (35 percent), Exim Bank 
China (23 percent), the Export Development Bank of Iran, the 
Abu Dhabi Fund for Development and the Solidarity Fund for 
Development (about 7 percent each), the Arab Fund for

total payments for the railway and water projects to about USD 20 million over 2024–27 (compared to 
about USD 276 million previously) and reprofiled the payment of USD 314 million (8 percent of GDP) of 
arrears on these projects. Following the moratorium, Exim Bank India has become the creditor to whom 
Djibouti owes the highest amount of arrears. In this DSA, arrears on interests are added to the stock of 
debt and accrue interest at the same rate as the loan in arrears.  

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK 

7.       The outlook remains favorable. Growth and the external balance are primarily influenced 
by economic prospects in Ethiopia, which remain cautiously optimistic following the US’s announced 
tariffs on April 2. This optimism is bolstered by higher gold and coffee prices, currency depreciation 
resulting from the recent exchange rate reforms, ongoing macroeconomic stabilization, and a 
relatively little exposed financial account. However, Djibouti’s expected fiscal consolidation and the 
anticipated reversal in transshipments, as regional security stabilizes and Red Sea shipping lines 
reopen, are likely to weigh on the medium-term outlook. Overall, growth is projected to moderate 
to its pre-pandemic average of 5½ percent by 2030. Inflation is projected to ease to 1.4 percent 
over the medium term, as core inflation declines alongside growth, and both food and energy 
inflation moderate in line with projected international prices. The current account surplus is 
expected to narrow to approximately 8.3 percent of GDP, driven by re-exports to rapidly growing 
Ethiopia and robust imports momentum associated with port expansion and renewable energy 
projects in the pipeline. 

8.       Nonetheless, significant risks cloud the outlook. A resurgence of conflict in Tigray, or 
deteriorating relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea, may lead to an increase in refugee flows into 
Djibouti which, alongside the withdrawal of USAID support, may potentially strain food supply and 
destabilize social conditions, especially in a context of limited job creation and tight budgetary 
resources. The exposure to the risk scenarios as the ones outlined in the April 2025 WEO is deemed 
moderate. Delays in fiscal consolidation, debt negotiations, and the development of the Berbera 
port in Somaliland, could lead to continued declines in foreign reserves. On the upside, expedited 
debt renegotiations, stronger SOE governance and revenue mobilization could enhance fiscal space 
and the overall economic outlook.  

9.       Climate change also poses risks to Djibouti’s macroeconomic outlook. Primary sources 
of climate change risk are rising temperatures, a higher frequency of extreme weather events, and 
extended droughts. These factors may impact water resources, food security, and the livelihoods of 
populations. The World Bank’s 2024 Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) on Djibouti 
estimated that climate impacts could amount to a permanent annual loss of up to 6 percent of GDP 
by mid-century. Most of output losses would derive from damage to roads and associated delays, as 
well as labor productivity decline due to heat. Priority adaptation investments and policies could 
reduce these losses to 1 to 3 percent of GDP. The set of priority reforms and investments proposed 
in the CCDR’s adaptation scenario would require an estimated USD 1.1 billion in funding. In view of 
the uncertainty surrounding prospects for adaptation investments, this DSA excludes them. 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND     5 

 
DJIBOUTI 

10.       The baseline fiscal and financing projections incorporate assumptions aimed at 
improving Djibouti’s debt position, consistent with ongoing consolidation efforts: 

•  Fiscal and revenues outlook. The central government balance is expected to average around 

0.11 percent of GDP over the next decade with a primary surplus of 0.04 percent of GDP. Total PPG 
debt service is expected to increase from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2024 to an average of 4 percent, 
peaking at 5 percent in 2028 upon the expiration of the current debt moratorium with Exim Bank 
China. The projections incorporate a measured increase in tax revenue of 0.2 percent of GDP in 
2025 (0.1 percentage point less than the authorities’ estimates5), followed by a 0.08 percentage 
points of GDP increase annually from 2026 to 2030. Non-tax revenues incorporate the increase in 
revenues from military leases. The recent dissolution of the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) presents 
an upside risk to the fiscal outlook. It is expected to generate permanently higher budget revenues 
through increased dividend payments as well as the devolution of payments from military bases. 

•  Expenditures outlook. Expenditures are expected to decrease as a share of GDP, from a 

combination of the pursuit of the decrease of the current expenditure to GDP ratio and a 
stabilization of the capital expenditure to GDP ratio. Furthermore, the authorities’ 2024–27 fiscal 
reform action plan aims to consolidate expenditures through measures including reductions in 
water, phone, fuel, and electricity costs through meter checks and the installation of solar panels 
in public buildings; conducting an inventory to develop a plan to sell certain assets; restricting 
travel abroad; freezing contracts with non-essential providers; ensuring timely retirement for civil 
servants and promoting early, non-replacement retirements; reviewing civil servants’ hiring and 
benefits; and pausing lower-priority investments.  

•  SOEs outlook. SOEs are expected to remain broadly balanced in the medium term. The baseline 

scenario assumes that SOEs will generate sufficient cash flow to service the debt incurred for the 
projects they oversee, as investments in the pipeline gradually phase out. 

•  Financing outlook.  The projections incorporate the EIB loan planned for 2025, conservative 
assumptions regarding IDA allocations, and planned projects for a total amount of USD 227 
million. Some uncertainty remains around these assumptions given the lack of a Medium-Term 
Debt Strategy.  

11.       The authorities are actively pursuing discussions to resolve the accumulated external 
arrears and obtain debt relief. Over the next decade, the anticipated fiscal efforts, together with 
the moratorium with Exim Bank China lasting through 2027, are expected to prevent the 
accumulation of arrears and ensure the timely servicing of debt payments. Discussions with Exim 
Bank China regarding the debt terms are anticipated to conclude in 2025, which should assist in 
addressing the accumulation of arrears and temper the expected increase in debt service payments 

5 In 2025, the authorities have undertaken reforms to direct and indirect taxation, encompassing the general business 
tax, the tax on professional profits, the tax on dividends, the tax on mobile money transfers and the VAT. They have 
also introduced electronic payment for the vehicle road tax, the stamp duty and licensing fees. According to their 
estimates, direct, indirect taxation measures, and the introduction of electronic payment are expected to generate 
around 0.27, 0.01 and 0.03 percent of GDP in additional revenues, respectively.

COUNTRY CLASSIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF 
SCENARIO STRESS TESTS 
12.       Djibouti’s debt-carrying capacity is classified as weak. The debt sustainability framework 
encompasses a broad set of indicators to define debt carrying capacity and applicable thresholds. 
The underlying composite indicator (CI) accounts for the CPIA, real GDP growth rate, import 
coverage of reserves, remittances and world economic growth. With the current CI estimated at 2.10, 
Djibouti’s debt carrying capacity is classified as weak, with the largest contributions to the 
composite indicator from the CPIA and world economic growth. While this is a standardized 
methodology, it is worth noting that Djibouti’s nontraditional imports affect the CI and debt-
carrying capacity. As a hub for Ethiopia, about two thirds of Djibouti’s imports are re-exported to 
Ethiopia. Since these reexports are not expected to be a direct draw on the country’s reserves, the 
value of the CI score appears underestimated.  

13.       This DSA applies the standard stress tests (Tables 3 and 4). The standard tests account 
for shocks in real GDP growth, the primary balance, exports, other external financing flows and the

exchange rate. Given the Djibouti franc’s stability vis-à-vis the dollar under the currency board, the 
DSA exchange rate stress scenario should be considered a tail risk event.

 EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT 

14.       Under the baseline scenario, two of the four external debt burden indicators are 
projected to breach their respective thresholds throughout the medium term (Figure 1). The 
present value (PV) of the external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak at 54.5 percent in 2025, 
subsequently declining to 27.9 percent by 2032, and continuing to decrease while remaining below 
the threshold from 2033 onward. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to remain above the 
threshold until 2032 included, and fall below the threshold in 2033. Both the PV of debt-to-exports 
and the debt service-to-exports ratios are anticipated to remain consistently below the relevant 
thresholds across the projection horizon.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

 
 
 
 
DJIBOUTI 

15.       The debt dynamics are sensitive to shocks. The stress tests indicate that the most extreme 
shock for both PV of external debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-revenues is the exports shock, which 
could stem from a slowdown in economic growth in Ethiopia or a slowdown in international trade. 
The PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio raises to 147 percent in 2027 and stays above 100 percent 
until 2032, before progressively decreasing to 79 percent in 2035. The debt service-to-revenues ratio 
rises from an 18 percent average over 2025–27 to a 31 percent average over 2028–2035.  

OVERALL RISK OF PUBLIC DEBT DISTRESS 

16.       Under the baseline scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is above threshold until 2030 
(Figure 2). It peaks at 54.5 percent in 2025 and declines continuously but remains above the 35 percent 
threshold until 2030 included, before falling below the threshold in 2031 when it reaches 31.5 percent. 
The divergence in trajectory from the historical scenario indicates a notable slowdown in the pace of 
investments, now that the major infrastructure projects have been undertaken. 

RISK RATING AND VULNERABILITIES 

17.       Djibouti remains in debt distress, and debt is deemed unsustainable. The moratorium 
with Exim Bank China and the increase in revenues from military leases create only temporary fiscal 
room. Restoring debt sustainability requires the completion of debt negotiations with creditors, 
sustained fiscal consolidation, improved SOE dividend payments to the budget, strengthened public 
debt management and restricting financing to concessional financing. 

18.       Finalizing debt negotiations with major creditors and adopting a medium-term debt 
strategy is essential for restoring debt sustainability. As the authorities strive to negotiate new 
debt terms with Exim Bank China in 2025, they should concurrently advance their engagements with 
Exim Bank India and Paris Club creditors. Establishing a medium-term public debt strategy that 
includes binding annual borrowing limits for the central government and SOEs—encompassing their 
participation in Public-Private Partnerships—and ensuring these measures are enforced by the 
Public Sector Debt Committee, would help anchor debt sustainability.  

19.       Building on the Strategy for the Reform of Public Financial Management, and the 
2024–27 action plan, sustaining fiscal consolidation over the medium-term is the second pillar 
towards achieving debt sustainability. The envisaged expenditure containment and revenue 
mobilization measures would bring much needed additional resources. Priorities in 2025 include 
(i) the finalization of the digitalization and integration of information systems across tax 
administrations; (ii) the operationalization of the large taxpayer office (LTO); and (iii) the 
establishment of the tax policy unit (TPU) to strengthen tax policy and enhance reform efficiency. In 
the medium-term, a thorough review of the substantial fiscal cost of tax expenditures and fuel 
subsidies could serve as a basis for their rationalization.  

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND     9 

 
 
 
 
DJIBOUTI 

20.       Advancing SOE governance reforms is critical to creating fiscal space. The authorities 
should continue to implement the Code on Good SOE Governance adopted in 2016. The Secretariat 
Exécutif en charge du Portefeuille de l’Etat (SEPE) has established a register for SOEs and started 
agreeing objectives and KPI-based performance contracts with some SOEs. Additional measures are 
needed to strengthen SOE performance and monitoring, and to ensure gradual debt reduction of 
highly indebted SOEs and a sustainable flow of dividends from profitable SOEs to the budget, while 
limiting fiscal transfers to loss-making ones. In 2025, Djibouti should mandate the submission of all 
SOE financial statements to the SEPE, including those formerly under the dissolved SWF, establish a 
dividend policy grounded in financial performance, and finalize the review of SOE independent 
boards by implementing updated candidate qualification criteria. In 2026, Djibouti should complete 
the review of the SOE portfolio and determine whether to retain, restructure, or divest each entity.  

21.       Access to concessional loans and grants will be key to lower debt vulnerabilities. 
Several factors contribute to mitigating debt vulnerabilities, including the lack of roll-over risks 
associated with short-term debt, relatively modest interest rates on most obligations, and access to 
concessional financing. The authorities should prioritize reducing the scope for new borrowing, and 
if additional borrowing is deemed necessary, it should be undertaken solely on concessional terms. 
Moreover, enhanced access to grants would support a more rapid restoration of debt sustainability.  

Authorities’ Views 

22.       The authorities acknowledged that debt had reached a high level. They also noted that 
the current debt levels were attributable to substantial investments in two strategic sectors vital for 
the nation’s development: the drinking water sector, aimed at mitigating Djibouti’s persistent water 
stress, and the railway sector, designed to connect the country’s logistics platform to its primary 
market, Ethiopia. They also emphasized that within this framework, fiscal reforms introduced by the 
2025 Finance Law, adjustments to military base rental agreements, and ongoing negotiations with 
major creditors were all intended to facilitate a long-term restructuring of the debt and promote its 
sustainability.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + Ɛα (1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, Ɛ=nominal appreciation of the local currency, and α= share of local currency-denominated external debt in total external debt. 

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.

4/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.  

5/  Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

6/  Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

7/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

8/ Historical averages are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability, whereas projections averages are over the first year of projection and the next 10 years.

1/ Coverage of debt: The central government, central bank, government-guaranteed debt . Definition of external debt is Residency-based.

2/ The underlying PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio under the public DSA differs from the external DSA with the size of differences depending on exchange rates projections. 

3/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term, and short-term debt.

4/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period and other debt creating/reducing flows.

5/ Defined as a primary deficit minus a change in the public debt-to-GDP ratio ((-): a primary surplus), which would stabilizes the debt ratio only in the year in question. 

6/ Historical averages are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability, whereas projections averages are over the first year of projection and the next 10 years.
