Executive Board Assessment 

Djibouti is positioned to leverage its economic resilience to tackle fiscal and development 
challenges. Djibouti has handled recent shocks well, maintaining solid growth despite Red Sea 
tensions, with moderate inflation and rising reserves. Logistics investments over the past decade 
have boosted growth and economic transformation but increased external debt, leaving limited 
fiscal space considering development needs. In a challenging global climate, the authorities’ focus 
on macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability, and economic diversification to support job creation 
is commendable.  

Growth stays robust amid regional conflicts. Economic growth is expected to have surpassed 6½ 
percent of GDP in 2024, driven by higher transshipment activity alongside robust expansion in the 
construction, commerce, telecommunications and tourism sectors. Moderation in international food 
and energy prices has contributed to keeping inflation contained. In 2024, substantial fiscal 
consolidation was realized, which aided in rebuilding reserves and partially offset the decline seen 
since late 2023; however, reserve levels remain below the monetary base. The authorities’ plan to 
maintain strong fiscal consolidation, aiming for a government surplus this year and a balanced 
budget in the medium term, is welcome.  

The outlook is positive but faces risks amid global uncertainty. Growth is projected to remain strong 
at about 6 percent in 2025, then to stabilize near 5½ percent in the medium term, largely driven by 
Ethiopia’s strong demand for port services. Inflation is projected to remain subdued in line with 
global energy and food prices. External risks include heightened instability in the Horn of Africa with 
increased migration potentially straining social conditions amid constrained fiscal space, reduced 
development aid, new competition from nearby ports, and global policy shifts possibly weakening 
the dollar and Djibouti franc, spurring service exports but raising inflation.   

Djibouti needs to restore debt sustainability and rebuild reserves through a mix of fiscal 
consolidation, SOE reform, and debt negotiations. Clearing all arrears and finalizing debt 
negotiations is key to restore debt sustainability, alongside the containment of public and publicly 
guaranteed debt through quantified and enforced ceilings on both SOE and central government 
debt. This should be complemented by durable fiscal consolidation. To sustain progress, it is 
imperative to ensure the effective implementation of the revenue and expenditure measures 
outlined in the authorities’ 2024–27 Action Plan for fiscal reforms as well as rationalize tax 
expenditures associated with the derogatory regimes.

Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to accelerate SOE governance reform. Swiftly 
implementing the Code of Good SOE Governance, including by collecting financial statements from 
all SOEs to allow performance monitoring, together with enforcing a transparent dividend policy, 

and gradually deleveraging those highly indebted, will contribute to achieving debt sustainability. In 
addition, staff encourages the authorities to review the SOE portfolio to determine whether to 
retain, restructure, or divest each entity to improve the efficiency of the sector. The authorities 
should also apply a market-based approach to financial settlement practices between SOEs and the 
state.  

Building on the recent recovery in reserves, the authorities should pursue a comprehensive strategy 
to strengthen the currency board. Alongside amending the CBD law to enhance its autonomy and 
implementing reserve requirements incrementally, the CBD should consider retaining future CBD 
profits to further bolster reserves. Furthermore, sustaining fiscal consolidation and leveraging 
dividends from profitable SOEs, including ex-SWF entities, remain essential measures to minimize 
the recurrence of overdrafts.   

Speeding up reforms to boost private investment, diversify the economy, and create jobs would 
further support the authorities’ commitment to inclusive growth. Leveling the playing field between 
companies operating under the general and special regimes, and lowering electricity costs by 
curbing government agencies' overuse and improving bill collection, will buttress Djibouti’s 
investment momentum. Enhancing SME financing and strengthening education and job training 
under the 2021–35 education master plan is essential for private sector growth and the effective 
implementation of the ‘Vision 2035’ national development strategy.  

High quality data coverage will support policy making and strengthen surveillance. The authorities 
have taken important steps to improve the dissemination and quality of macroeconomic statistics 
and are determined to further improve the coverage and consistency of national, fiscal, and external 
accounts data in line with DAA requirements. Advancements in data compilation methods and the 
timely publication of statistics will further enhance economic analysis and policy making.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2025 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION 

KEY ISSUES 
Context. Djibouti's investment-focused strategy has propelled average growth rates to about 
6 percent over the past decade, leading to a doubling of GDP per capita. However, substantial 
public investment coupled with declining revenues and rising debt service have constrained fiscal 
space and put pressure on debt sustainability. In 2024, growth remained strong at about 
6½ percent, driven by robust transshipment amid Red Sea maritime disruptions. Inflation was 
moderate, and fiscal and reserve positions improved following temporary overruns. The 
authorities are pursuing fiscal consolidation and debt negotiations to restore debt sustainability 
and strengthen reserves.  

Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to hold at about 6 percent in 2025 and stay robust over 
the medium term, fueled by rising Ethiopian demand for Djibouti's port services. Inflation is 
expected to ease as global food and energy prices moderate. Risks to the outlook include 
heightened instability in the Horn of Africa and increased migration potentially straining social 
conditions, reduced development aid, and new competition from nearby ports. On the upside, a 
potential weakening of the dollar may help boost port activity, and private sector investment 
may exceed expectations, supported by Djibouti’s stable economy, currency board, modern 
ports, and connectivity to Ethiopia's expansive market. 

Policy recommendations. Priorities include restoring debt sustainability through effective fiscal 
consolidation, State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform, and debt negotiations, as well as 
strengthening the currency board and promoting inclusive growth. Key policy recommendations: 

• Advance fiscal consolidation by broadening tax revenues, rationalizing non-priority spending,
and enforcing SOE dividend payments to the budget; set comprehensive debt ceilings that
include all public and publicly guaranteed debt. Complete debt renegotiations and arrears
clearance with creditors.

•

•

•

Further SOE reform by ensuring timely disclosure of all financial statements and
strengthening their oversight, enabling the commercial operation of SOEs through a
framework governing their financial relations with the government, and finalizing the SOE
portfolio review to determine which entities to retain, restructure, or divest to improve the
efficiency of the sector.

Continue to rebuild reserves by maintaining fiscal discipline, mobilizing SOE dividends, and
reinforcing the central bank's autonomy under the currency board.

Promote economic diversification and job growth by prioritizing investments in human
capital, standardizing taxation across different regimes while substantially narrowing tax
exemptions, and continue reforming the energy sector.
