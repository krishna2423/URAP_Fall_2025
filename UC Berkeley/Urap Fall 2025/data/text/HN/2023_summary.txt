This paper presents Honduras’ 2023 Article IV Consultation and Requests for an Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility and an Arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility. These arrangements provide support for the Honduran government’s economic and institutional reform agenda over the next three years. The program also aims to support the authorities’ efforts to improve governance and transparency and fight corruption. The program will advance policies needed to strengthen economic resilience and address structural bottlenecks to boost inclusive growth, including by increasing public investment while safeguarding macroeconomic stability. Reforms in the energy sector will be essential to limit fiscal risks and improve the business environment. The authorities are implementing a comprehensive loss reduction plan to strengthen the financial position of the public electricity company and enhance the provision of electricity. In this context, the program also aims to support the authorities’ efforts to build resilience to climate change.
