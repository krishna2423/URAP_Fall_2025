The 2024 Article IV Consultation highlights that Haiti faces an unprecedented multidimensional crisis encompassing humanitarian, economic, social, and security problems. The economy has a low tax base and a large informal sector that relies heavily on volatile remittance flows. Haiti’s macroeconomic outlook is challenging and subject to elevated uncertainty. The supply-side shock caused by the security crisis would continue to greatly affect growth and feed inflation unless the security outlook improves. The analytical work underpinning the policy discussions, prepared by staff in agreement with the authorities, focuses on strengthening policy frameworks to enhance resilience. The report recommends implementing the budget for FY2025 and keeps the monetary financing of the budget to zero, consistent with the objective of price stability. It is also recommended to provide more timely data to the IMF and enhance data transparency through timeline publication of core economic data. It can also be beneficial to adopt measures to strengthen revenue collection, expenditure management and controls and increase budget allocations for social spending and for protecting the most vulnerable—and assess their impact.
