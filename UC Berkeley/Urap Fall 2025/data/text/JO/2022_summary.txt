This paper discusses Jordan’s 2022 Article IV Consultation and Fourth Review under the Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Request for Augmentation and Rephasing of Access, and Modification of Performance Criteria. Jordan's EFF program remains firmly on track. The authorities have maintained macroeconomic stability and market access, while protecting the most vulnerable, and implementing key structural reforms, especially in the area of public finances. The IMF remains committed to supporting Jordan, including by augmenting access under the EFF to help address higher financing needs from higher international commodity prices and tightened global financial conditions. Donor support is critical to enable Jordan to cope with these global economic headwinds, while hosting 1.3 million Syrian refugees.
