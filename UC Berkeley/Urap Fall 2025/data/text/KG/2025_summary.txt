The 2025 Article IV Consultation discusses that the Kyrgyz Republic has shown strong economic performance despite global uncertainties with robust growth, stabilizing inflation, and declining public debt. Growth is expected to gradually moderate as external trade normalizes and domestic demand slows, while inflation remains stable with continued prudent monetary policy. In view of the heightened global uncertainty, medium term priorities include rebuilding policy buffers and advancing structural reforms to strengthen economy’s resilience to shocks and support higher and more inclusive growth. Strong revenue performance and a prudent fiscal stance coupled with high gross domestic product growth have contained public debt. In order to further strengthen fiscal sustainability and create fiscal space for large development needs, the authorities should enhance tax policy by reducing tax exemptions and special tax regimes, increasing progressivity of the Personal Income Tax, and further strengthening revenue administration. Sustaining macroeconomic stability and strengthening inclusive growth will require rebuilding policy buffers, enhancing fiscal sustainability, safeguarding monetary policy independence, and advancing structural reforms to boost productivity.
