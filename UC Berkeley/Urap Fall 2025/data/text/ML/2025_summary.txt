Mali faced another difficult year in 2024: persistent security attacks, protracted power outages, food insecurity, and catastrophic floods—prompting Fund support under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) in April 2025. Although the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has now removed Mali from its grey list, investors still see high policy uncertainty around the implementation of the 2023 mining code reforms, post-ECOWAS exit arrangements, and the suspension of political parties and elections. Adding to the strain, the country’s largest gold mine shut in January 2025 over a tax dispute tied to the new mining code; operations have recently been placed under a six-month court-appointed administrator, but the timing of a full restart—and the return of critical mining revenues—remains unclear.
