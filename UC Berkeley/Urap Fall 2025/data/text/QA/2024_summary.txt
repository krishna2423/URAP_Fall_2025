The 2024 Article IV Consultation with Qatar highlights that growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of activities strengthening more recently. Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually.

Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the recent IMF technical assistance. Successful Third National Development Strategy implementation requires proper reform prioritization and inter-agency coordination.
