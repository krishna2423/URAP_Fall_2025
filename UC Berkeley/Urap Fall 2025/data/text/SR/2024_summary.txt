This paper presents Suriname’s 2024 Article IV Consultation and the Eight Review under the Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility, Requests for Modification of Performance Criteria, Waivers of Nonobservance of Performance Criteria, and Financing Assurances Review. Suriname is implementing an ambitious economic reform agenda to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, while laying the foundations for strong and more inclusive growth. The authorities’ steadfast commitment to maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and implementing difficult but necessary reforms are yielding positive results: the economy is growing, inflation is declining, donor engagement is deepening, and investor confidence is returning. The Final Investment Decision announcement in the new offshore field has boosted the medium-term outlook in the country. Building on the progress made thus far, the authorities should entrench fiscal discipline, particularly in the run up to the elections while protecting the vulnerable. In view of the upcoming oil wealth, strengthening the fiscal framework, including through the introduction of new fiscal rules, and addressing governance weaknesses is critical.
